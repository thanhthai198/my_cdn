00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
There are three easy steps to the interview process.

00:03.660 --> 00:07.660
Step one is to sign into the app and enter your info.

00:07.660 --> 00:12.660
As a member of Tradewize, you are paid immediately at each job completion,

00:12.660 --> 00:18.060
so be sure to enter the correct information in order to not have delay in your payment.

00:18.060 --> 00:22.300
You will be able to change or edit your information at any time

00:22.300 --> 00:25.260
after you are given access to our network.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.260
Step two is to take a test so we can understand your background

00:29.260 --> 00:33.420
in order to fit you to a role that suits your experience.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.920
This is not a pass or fail test.

00:35.920 --> 00:40.920
It helps us ensure you are placed into a position that you will thrive in.

00:40.920 --> 00:46.920
After the test, you will receive a link to set up a time for a 30-minute virtual interview.

00:46.920 --> 00:51.820
Following this interview, you will receive a message and be assigned a role.

00:51.820 --> 00:55.420
When clicked, you are given access to your home screen

00:55.420 --> 01:01.420
and can begin the short onboarding process to grow your future with the Tradewize network.
