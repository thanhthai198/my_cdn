-------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollView` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. This is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\n// Public methods for ScrollView\n                                                      \n

while providing\n * integration with touch locking \"responder\" system.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ScrollViews must have a bounded height in order to work,\n * since they contain unbounded-height children into a bounded container (via\n * a scroll interaction). In order to bound the height of a ScrollView, either\n * set the height of the view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent\n * views have bounded height. Forgetting to transfer `{flex: 1}` down the\n * view stack can lead to errors here, which the element inspector makes\n * easy to debug.\n *\n * Doesn't yet support other contained responders from blocking this scroll\n * view from becoming the responder.\n *\n *\n * `<ScrollView>` vs [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) - which one to use?\n *\n * `ScrollView` simply renders all its react child components at once. That\n * makes it very easy to understand and use.\n *\n * On the other hand, this has a performance downside. Imagine you have a very\n * long list of items you want to display, maybe several screens worth of\n * content. Creating JS components and native views for everything all at once,\n * much of which may not even be shown, will contribute to slow rendering and\n * increased memory usage.\n *\n * This is where `FlatList` comes into play. `FlatList` renders items lazily,\n * just when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off\n * screen to save memory and processing time.\n *\n * `FlatList` is also handy if you want to render separators between your items,\n * multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it\n * supports out of the box.\n */\nclass ScrollView extends React.Component               {\n  static Context                           = ScrollViewContext;\n\n  constructor(props       ) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this._scrollAnimatedValue = new AnimatedImplementation.Value(\n      this.props.contentOffset?.y ?? 0,\n    );\n    this._scrollAnimatedValue.setOffset(this.props.contentInset?.top ?? 0);\n  }\n\n  _scrollAnimatedValue                              ;\n  _scrollAnimatedValueAttachment                             = null;\n  _stickyHeaderRefs                                                           =\n    new Map();\n  _headerLayoutYs                      = new Map();\n\n  _keyboardMetrics                   = null;\n  _additionalScrollOffset         = 0;\n  _isTouching          = false;\n  _lastMomentumScrollBeginTime         = 0;\n  _lastMomentumScrollEndTime         = 0;\n\n  // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

Without setting this prop, `FlatList` would not know it\n *   needs to re-render any items because it is also a `PureComponent` and the prop comparison will\n *   not show any changes.\n * - `keyExtractor` tells the list to use the `id`s for the react keys instead of the default `key` property.\n *\n *\n *     class MyListItem extends React.PureComponent {\n *       _onPress = () => {\n *         this.props.onPressItem(this.props.id);\n *       };\n *\n *       render() {\n *         const textColor = this.props.selected ? \"red\" : \"black\";\n *         return (\n *           <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPress}>\n *             <View>\n *               <Text style={{ color: textColor }}>\n *                 {this.props.title}\n *               </Text>\n *             </View>\n *           </TouchableOpacity>\n *         );\n *       }\n *     }\n *\n *     class MultiSelectList extends React.PureComponent {\n *       state = {selected: (new Map(): Map<string, boolean>)};\n *\n *       _keyExtractor = (item, index) => item.id;\n *\n *       _onPressItem = (id: string) => {\n *         // updater functions are preferred for transactional updates\n *         this.setState((state) => {\n *           // copy the map rather than modifying state.\n *           const selected = new Map(state.selected);\n *           selected.set(id, !selected.get(id)); // toggle\n *           return {selected};\n *         });\n *       };\n *\n *       _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n *         <MyListItem\n *           id={item.id}\n *           onPressItem={this._onPressItem}\n *           selected={!!this.state.selected.get(item.id)}\n *           title={item.title}\n *         />\n *       );\n *\n *       render() {\n *         return (\n *           <FlatList\n *             data={this.props.data}\n *             extraData={this.state}\n *             keyExtractor={this._keyExtractor}\n *             renderItem={this._renderItem}\n *           />\n *         );\n *       }\n *     }\n *\n * This is a convenience wrapper around [`<VirtualizedList>`](docs/virtualizedlist.html),\n * and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed\n * here, along with the following caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\n\nconst States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the responder\n

Fully cross-platform.\n *  - Configurable viewability callbacks.\n *  - List header support.\n *  - List footer support.\n *  - Item separator support.\n *  - Section header support.\n *  - Section separator support.\n *  - Heterogeneous data and item rendering support.\n *  - Pull to Refresh.\n *  - Scroll loading.\n *\n * If you don't need section support and want a simpler interface, use\n * [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).\n *\n * Simple Examples:\n *\n *     <SectionList\n *       renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item} />}\n *       renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <Header title={section.title} />}\n *       sections={[ // homogeneous rendering between sections\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *       ]}\n *     />\n *\n *     <SectionList\n *       sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *       ]}\n *     />\n *\n * This is a convenience wrapper around [`<VirtualizedList>`](docs/virtualizedlist),\n * and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed\n * here, along with the following caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nexport default class SectionList \n                             \n  extends React.PureComponent                        {\n  props                 ;\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the item at the specified `sectionIndex` and `itemIndex` (within the section)\n   * positioned in the viewable area such that `viewPosition` 0 places it at the top (and may be\n   * covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle. `viewOffset` is a\n   * fixed number of pixels to offset the final target position, e.g. to compensate for sticky\n   * headers.\n   *\n   * Note: cannot scroll to locations outside the render window without specifying the\n   * `getItemLayout` prop.\n   */\n  scrollToLocation(params                            ) {\n    if (this._wrapperListRef != null) {\n      this._wrapperListRef.scrollToLocation(params);\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Tells the list an interaction has occurred, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g.\n   * if `waitForInteractions` is true and the user has not scrolled.

These methods have the same\n * behavior as mounting and unmounting a `StatusBar` component.\n *\n * For example, you can call `StatusBar.pushStackEntry` to update the status bar\n * before launching a third-party native UI component, and then call\n * `StatusBar.popStackEntry` when completed.\n *\n * ```\n * const openThirdPartyBugReporter = async () => {\n *   // The bug reporter has a dark background, so we push a new status bar style.\n *   const stackEntry = StatusBar.pushStackEntry({barStyle: 'light-content'});\n *\n *   // `open` returns a promise that resolves when the UI is dismissed.\n *   await BugReporter.open();\n *\n *   // Don't forget to call `popStackEntry` when you're done.\n *   StatusBar.popStackEntry(stackEntry);\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * There is a legacy imperative API that enables you to manually update the\n * status bar styles. However, the legacy API does not update the internal\n * `StatusBar` display stack, which means that any changes will be overridden\n * whenever a `StatusBar` component is mounted or unmounted.\n *\n * It is strongly advised that you use `pushStackEntry`, `popStackEntry`, or\n * `replaceStackEntry` instead of the static methods beginning with `set`.\n *\n * ### Constants\n *\n * `currentHeight` (Android only) The height of the status bar.\n */\nclass StatusBar extends React.Component        {\n  static _propsStack             = [];\n\n  static _defaultProps      = createStackEntry({\n    backgroundColor:\n      Platform.OS === 'android'\n        ?

(`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)\n * // later, on animation completion:\n * InteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);\n * // queued tasks run if all handles were cleared\n * ```\n *\n * `runAfterInteractions` takes either a plain callback function, or a\n * `PromiseTask` object with a `gen` method that returns a `Promise`.  If a\n * `PromiseTask` is supplied, then it is fully resolved (including asynchronous\n * dependencies that also schedule more tasks via `runAfterInteractions`) before\n * starting on the next task that might have been queued up synchronously\n * earlier.\n *\n * By default, queued tasks are executed together in a loop in one\n * `setImmediate` batch.

which allows\n * the underlay color to show through, darkening or tinting the view.\n *\n * The underlay comes from wrapping the child in a new View, which can affect\n * layout, and sometimes cause unwanted visual artifacts if not used correctly,\n * for example if the backgroundColor of the wrapped view isn't explicitly set\n * to an opaque color.\n *\n * TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one).\n * If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```\n * renderButton: function() {\n *   return (\n *     <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onPressButton}>\n *       <Image\n *         style={styles.button}\n *         source={require('./myButton.png')}\n *       />\n *     </TouchableHighlight>\n *   );\n * },\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react'\n * import {\n *   AppRegistry,\n *   StyleSheet,\n *   TouchableHighlight,\n *

It makes\n * single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to\n * recognize simple multi-touch gestures.\n *\n * By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block\n * long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.\n *\n * It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the\n * [gesture responder system](docs/gesture-responder-system.html).\n * For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the\n * native event object:\n *\n * ```\n * onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}\n * ```\n *\n * A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:\n *\n *  - `nativeEvent`\n *      + `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event\n *      + `identifier` - The ID of the touch\n *      + `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event\n *      + `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation\n *      + `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen\n *\n * A `gestureState` object has the following:\n *\n *  - `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least\n *     one touch on screen\n *  - `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `vx` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `vy` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen\n *\n * ### Basic Usage\n *\n * ```\n *   componentWillMount: function() {\n *     this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n *       // Ask to be the responder:\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *\n *       onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows\n *         // what is happening!\n *\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}\n *\n *         // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y}\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The user has released all touches while this view is the\n *         // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture\n *         // should be cancelled\n *       },\n *       onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS\n *         // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.\n *         return true;\n *       },\n *     });\n *   },\n *\n *   render: function() {\n *     return (\n *       <View {...this._panResponder.panHandlers} />\n *     );\n *   },\n *\n * ```\n *\n * ### Working Example\n *\n * To see it in action, try the\n * [PanResponder example in

The \"right thing\" is very\n   * nuanced. When moving two touches in opposite directions, the cumulative\n   * distance is zero in each dimension. When two touches move in parallel five\n   * pixels in the same direction, the cumulative distance is five, not ten. If\n   * two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other\n   * touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.\n   *\n   * This logic requires a kind of processing of time \"clusters\" of touch events\n   * so that two touch moves that essentially occur in parallel but move every\n   * other frame respectively, are considered part of the same movement.\n   *\n   * Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:\n   *\n   * - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is\n   *   invalid.

If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance. Accounts for touch moves that are clustered together in time,\n   *   moving the same direction.

This is\n   * to (at least) handle the case where the user is moving three fingers, and\n   * then one of the fingers stops but the other two continue.\n   *\n   * This is very different than taking all of the recently moved touches and\n   * storing their centroid as `dx/dy`. For correctness, we must *accumulate\n   * changes* in the centroid of recently moved touches.\n   *\n   * There is also some nuance with how we handle multiple moved touches in a\n   * single event.

Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable={true}\n *         maxLength={40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline={true}\n *          numberOfLines={4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border\n * has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it\n * cannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this is to either not set height\n * explicitly, case in which the system will take care of displaying the border\n * in the correct position, or to not display the border by setting\n * `underlineColorAndroid` to transparent.\n *\n * Note that on Android performing text selection in input can change\n * app's activity `windowSoftInputMode` param to `adjustResize`.\n * This may cause issues with components that have position: 'absolute'\n * while keyboard is active. To avoid this behavior either specify `windowSoftInputMode`\n * in AndroidManifest.xml ( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html )\n * or control this param programmatically with native code.\n *\n */\nfunction InternalTextInput(props       )             {\n  const {\n    'aria-busy': ariaBusy,\n    'aria-checked': ariaChecked,\n    'aria-disabled': ariaDisabled,\n    'aria-expanded': ariaExpanded,\n    'aria-selected': ariaSelected,\n    accessibilityState,\n    id,\n    tabIndex,\n    selection: propsSelection,\n    selectionColor,\n    selectionHandleColor,\n    cursorColor,\n    ...otherProps\n  } = props;\n\n  const inputRef = useRef                                               (null);\n\n  const selection             =\n    propsSelection == null\n      ? null\n      : {\n          start: propsSelection.start,\n          end: propsSelection.end ?? propsSelection.start,\n        };\n\n  const text =\n    typeof props.value === 'string'\n      ? props.value\n      : typeof props.defaultValue === 'string'\n        ? props.defaultValue\n        : '';\n\n  const viewCommands =\n    AndroidTextInputCommands ||\n    (props.multiline === true\n      ?

I'm sorry for this.\n\n      This is a hack. Ideally we would forwardRef to the underlying\n      host component. However, since TextInput has it's own methods that can be\n      called as well, if we used the standard forwardRef then these\n      methods wouldn't be accessible and thus be a breaking change.\n\n      We have a couple of options of how to handle this:\n      - Return a new ref with everything we methods from both. This is problematic\n        because we need React to also know it is a host component which requires\n        internals of the class implementation of the ref.\n      - Break the API and have some other way to call one set of the methods or\n        the other. This is our long term approach as we want to eventually\n        get the methods on host components off the ref. So instead of calling\n        ref.measure() you might call ReactNative.measure(ref). This would hopefully\n        let the ref for TextInput then have the methods like `.clear`. Or we do it\n        the other way and make it TextInput.clear(textInputRef) which would be fine\n        too.

Pressability implements press handling capabilities.\n *\n * =========================== Pressability Tutorial ===========================\n *\n * The `Pressability` class helps you create press interactions by analyzing the\n * geometry of elements and observing when another responder (e.g. ScrollView)\n * has stolen the touch lock. It offers hooks for your component to provide\n * interaction feedback to the user:\n *\n * - When a press has activated (e.g. highlight an element)\n * - When a press has deactivated (e.g. un-highlight an element)\n * - When a press should trigger an action, meaning it activated and deactivated\n *   while within the geometry of the element without the lock being stolen.\n *\n * A high quality interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should\n * be a slight delay before activation. Moving your finger beyond an element's\n * bounds should trigger deactivation, but moving the same finger back within an\n * element's bounds should trigger reactivation.\n *\n * This should be consumed by functional components using `usePressability`. The\n * following steps are only relevant for using `Pressability` in classes:\n *\n * 1. Instantiate `Pressability` and store it on your component's state.\n *\n *    state = {\n *      pressability: new Pressability({\n *        // ...\n *      }),\n *    };\n *\n * 2. Choose the rendered component who should collect the press events. On that\n *    element, spread `pressability.getEventHandlers()` into its props.\n *\n *    return (\n *      <View {...this.state.pressability.getEventHandlers()} />\n *    );\n *\n * 3. Update `Pressability` when your component mounts, updates, and unmounts.\n *\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      this.state.pressability.configure(...);\n *    }\n *\n *    componentDidUpdate() {\n *      this.state.pressability.configure(...);\n *    }\n *\n *    componentWillUnmount() {\n *      this.state.pressability.reset();\n *    }\n *\n * ==================== Pressability Implementation Details ====================\n *\n * `Pressability` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node. The `PressRect`\n * is an abstract box that is extended beyond the `HitRect`.\n *\n * # Geometry\n *\n *  ┌────────────────────────┐\n *  │  ┌──────────────────┐  │ - Presses start anywhere within `HitRect`, which\n *  │  │  ┌────────────┐  │  │   is expanded via the prop `hitSlop`.\n *  │  │  │ VisualRect │  │  │\n *  │  │  └────────────┘  │  │ - When pressed down for sufficient amount of time\n *  │  │    HitRect       │  │   before letting up, `VisualRect` activates for\n *  │  └──────────────────┘  │   as long as the press stays within `PressRect`.\n *  │       PressRect    o   │\n *  └────────────────────│───┘\n *          Out Region   └────── `PressRect`, which is expanded via the prop\n *                               `pressRectOffset`, allows presses to move\n *                               beyond `HitRect` while maintaining activation\n *                               and being eligible for a \"press\".\n *\n * # State Machine\n *\n * ┌───────────────┐ ◀──── RESPONDER_RELEASE\n * │ NOT_RESPONDER │\n * └───┬───────────┘ ◀──── RESPONDER_TERMINATED\n *     │\n *     │ RESPONDER_GRANT (HitRect)\n *     │\n *     ▼\n * ┌─────────────────────┐          ┌───────────────────┐              ┌───────────────────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │  T + DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_IN            ├────────▶ │ PRESS_IN          ├────────────▶ │ LONG_PRESS_IN     │\n * └─┬───────────────────┘          └─┬─────────────────┘              └─┬─────────────────┘\n *   │           ▲                    │           ▲                      │           ▲\n *   │LEAVE_     │                    │LEAVE_     │                      │LEAVE_     │\n *   │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_              │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_                │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_\n *   │           │PRESS_RECT          │           │PRESS_RECT            │           │PRESS_RECT\n *   ▼           │                    ▼           │                      ▼           │\n * ┌─────────────┴───────┐          ┌─────────────┴─────┐              ┌─────────────┴─────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │              │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_OUT           ├────────▶ │ PRESS_OUT         │              │ LONG_PRESS_OUT    │\n * └─────────────────────┘          └───────────────────┘              └───────────────────┘\n *\n * T + DELAY => LONG_PRESS_DELAY + DELAY\n *\n * Not drawn are the side effects of each transition.

To do this, wrap a\n * TextInput with the InputAccessoryView component, and don't set a nativeID.\n * For an example, look at InputAccessoryViewExample.js in RNTester.\n */\n\n                         \n                        \n     \n                                                                  \n                            \n     \n                     \n                         \n                                \n    \n\nconst InputAccessoryView                                 = (props       ) => {\n  const {width} = useWindowDimensions();\n\n  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {\n    if (React.Children.count(props.children) === 0) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <RCTInputAccessoryViewNativeComponent\n        style={[props.style, styles.container]}\n        nativeID={props.nativeID}\n        backgroundColor={props.backgroundColor}>\n        <SafeAreaView style={[styles.safeAreaView, {width}]}>\n          {props.children}\n        </SafeAreaView>\n      </RCTInputAccessoryViewNativeComponent>\n    );\n  } else {\n    console.warn('<InputAccessoryView> is only supported on iOS.');\n    return null;\n  }\n};\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    position: 'absolute',\n  },\n  safeAreaView: {\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n});\n\nexport default InputAccessoryView;\n","export * from '../../src/private/specs/modules/NativeAppState';\nimport NativeAppState from '../../src/private/specs/modules/NativeAppState';\nexport default NativeAppState;","/**\n * Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n *\n *      \n * @format\n */\n\nimport composeStyles from '../../src/private/styles/composeStyles';\nimport View from '../Components/View/View';\nimport useMergeRefs from '../Utilities/useMergeRefs';\nimport useAnimatedProps from './useAnimatedProps';\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport {useMemo} from 'react';\n\n                                           \n                                            \n                        \n                 \n                                                                    \n                      \n          \n                \n  \n\n                                  \n               \n                    \n                                                            \n\nexport default function createAnimatedComponent                          (\n  Component                                            ,\n)                                           {\n  const AnimatedComponent = React.forwardRef                                  (\n    (props, forwardedRef) => {\n      const [reducedProps, callbackRef] = useAnimatedProps                   (\n        // $FlowFixMe[incompatible-call]\n        props,\n      );\n      const ref = useMergeRefs           (callbackRef, forwardedRef);\n\n      // Some components require explicit passthrough values for animation\n      // to work properly.

{\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       refreshing: false,\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   _onRefresh() {\n *     this.setState({refreshing: true});\n *     fetchData().then(() => {\n *       this.setState({refreshing: false});\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <ListView\n *         refreshControl={\n *           <RefreshControl\n *

 }\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * __Note:__ `refreshing` is a controlled prop, this is why it needs to be set to true\n * in the `onRefresh` function otherwise the refresh indicator will stop immediately.\n */\nclass RefreshControl extends React.Component                      {\n  _nativeRef                    \n                                             \n
